# Community-Network-API

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a social networking API that can create and store users, add and remove friends from users, and add thoughts and reactions to a user database.
I wanted to build this API to create a future application for a social media platform.
With this API, I would handle user data and have users interact with other users with reactions, thoughts, and friends lists.
Overall, this project helped me learn how to use MongoDB and Mongoose to create a solid database structure for complex data models.
